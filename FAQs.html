						<h3>DO you have a program for home ownership? </h3>	
						<p>HACA does have a Homeownership/Down Payment Assistance Program. The program provides a maximum 
							loan of $10,000 on a first come, first serve basis to residents who meet the criteria. Residents
							must be a first time home buyer or cannot have owned a home in the last three years. A minimum of 
							$2,500 must also be contributed toward the down payment, closing cost or reserves. Residents
							must then qualify for a first lien mortgage and have received first mortgage financing from a 
							private financial institution. Lastly, a HACA-approved home buyer training course must be passed. 
							To learn more or download an application, visit our <a href="https://www.hacanet.org/residents/public-housing/">Homeownership program page.</a></p>
						
						<h3>I have a voucher and I want to move to Austin. Who do I contact?</h3>	
						<p>Call the Portability Counselor in the Housing Choice Voucher Department at (512) 477-1314 EXT 1342 
							or portability@hacanet.org. To fax information, send it to (512) 494-0686. </p>
						
						<h3>Where am I on the waiting list?</h3>	
						<p>The waiting list is updated nightly on the <a href="https://austin.ourpha.com/applicants/Public/Login/Login.aspx">Applicant Portal</a>. </p>
						
						<h3>How can I receive immediate housing? How do I apply?</h3>	
						<p>The Housing Authority of the City of Austin does not provide immediate housing. At this time the housing authority is accepting applications for 
							the public housing program. Once an application is filled out, applicants are placed on a waiting list according to the date and time of their application, size of the unit for which they qualify (public housing only) and local preference for which they may qualify. For immediate temporary housing, please contact the Salvation Army. </p>
