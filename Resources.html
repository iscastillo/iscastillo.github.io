						<h3>Know Your Housing Rights </h3>	
						<p>As the owner of a home you are entitled to housing rights. Likewise when renting a home or apartment unit. </p>
							<h4> Rights As A Tenant </h4>
								<ol>
								<li> The right to "quiet enjoyment" of your home. This means your landlord cannot evict you without proper cause 
									(most commonly nonpayment of rent) or otherwise disturb your right to live in peace and quiet.  
									Your landlord must also protect you from any wrongful actions taken by other tenants.</li>
								<li> The right to health and safety in your home. Your landlord has an obligation to repair any conditions in 
									your home that negatively affect your health and safety. </li>
								<li>  he right to security in your home. Your landlord must provide you with basic security measures for your home, 
								      which include working window latches; deadbolts on exterior  doors; locked, latches or security bars 
									on sliding doors, and door viewers (peep holes). </li>
								</ol>

							<h4> Rights If Immigration Is At Your Door </h4>
						<p> Immigration officers may not enter your home unless they have a “warrant.” A warrant is a document issued by a court or government agency. There are two 
							types of warrant —  one for when they are coming to arrest you, and another for when they have permission from a judge tosearch your home. U.S. Immigration 
							and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can issue arrest warrants, but only a court can issue a search warrant. </p>
								<ul>
								<li> If an officer knocks on your door, do not open it. Ask the officer through the closed door to identify himself. You can say, “Who are you with?”
									or “What agency are you with?” </li>
								<li> The officer might say that he is with  “Department of Homeland Security” or “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” The officer might name 
									another agency. No matter what, keep the door closed. Through the closed door, ask the officer if he has a warrant. </li>
									<ul>
										<li> If he says “yes,” still do not open the door.  Ask him to show you the warrant by slipping it under the door. </li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
