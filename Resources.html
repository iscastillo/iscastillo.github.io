						<p>As the owner of a home you are entitled to housing rights. Likewise when renting a home or apartment unit. </p>
							<h4> Rights As A Tenant </h4>
								<ol>
								<li> The right to "quiet enjoyment" of your home. This means your landlord cannot evict you without proper cause 
									(most commonly nonpayment of rent) or otherwise disturb your right to live in peace and quiet.  
									Your landlord must also protect you from any wrongful actions taken by other tenants.</li>
								<li> The right to health and safety in your home. Your landlord has an obligation to repair any conditions in 
									your home that negatively affect your health and safety. </li>
								<li>  he right to security in your home. Your landlord must provide you with basic security measures for your home, 
								      which include working window latches; deadbolts on exterior  doors; locked, latches or security bars 
									on sliding doors, and door viewers (peep holes). </li>
								</ol>

							<h4> Rights If Immigration Is At Your Door </h4>
						<p> Immigration officers may not enter your home unless they have a “warrant.” A warrant is a document issued by a court or government agency. There are two 
							types of warrant —  one for when they are coming to arrest you, and another for when they have permission from a judge tosearch your home. U.S. Immigration 
							and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can issue arrest warrants, but only a court can issue a search warrant. </p>
								<ul>
								<li> If an officer knocks on your door, do not open it. Ask the officer through the closed door to identify himself. You can say, “Who are you with?”
									or “What agency are you with?” </li>
								<li> The officer might say that he is with  “Department of Homeland Security” or “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” The officer might name 
									another agency. No matter what, keep the door closed. Through the closed door, ask the officer if he has a warrant. </li>
									<ul>
										<li> If he says “yes,” still do not open the door.  Ask him to show you the warrant by slipping it under the door. </li>
									</ul>
								<li> When examining the warrant, look for your name, your address, and a signature. This can help you decide whether or not the warrant is valid (true). 
									The warrant will be in English. If you have trouble reading it or understanding it, get someone else in your house to help you 
									read it or translate it, if possible. </li>
									<ul>
										<li> If the warrant does not look valid, you should return it under the door and say it is incorrect.</li>
										<li> If the warrant the officer shows you looks valid, look to see if it was issued by a court or by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </li>
										<li> If the valid warrant looks like it was issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) but not a court, you have the right not to let the officer enter
											your house. If the warrant authorizes your arrest but not a search of your house, you may want to go outside to meet the officers but not let them 
											in the house. This is especially important if you live with other people who might have immigration problems, because once you allow the officer 
											into your house, he can ask questions of anyone else who is there, too. </li>
									</ul>
								<li> If you do talk to the officer (again, outside your house — do not let him in), do not answer any questions. Do not sign any papers. Tell the officer you want to talk to a lawyer
									before you say anything. Do not provide any kind of identification documents that say what country you are from. Make sure not to carry any false documents with you at 
									any time. </li>
								</ul>
